    <h1>Data Science PhD Program</h1>
    <p>
       The University of Virginia seeks approval for the establishment of a new Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) degree program in Data Science at the main campus in Charlottesville. The proposed program will be administered by the Office of the Dean of the School of Data Science. </p>
<p>
The purpose of the proposed PhD in Data Science is to prepare data scientists for roles in academia and industry by creating a scholarly environment in which methodological creativity and innovation are applied to scientific and societally important problems. The proposed program will merge sophisticated data science research with the intricate details of practical applications to produce cycles of discovery across a wide range of disciplines. Embedding value-based and ethical analyses in all aspects of data science is a key focus of the proposed degree.

    <h5>Program Requirements</h5>

The proposed PhD in Data Science will require 81 credit hours. A dissertation is required.

The curriculum will provide students with the advanced knowledge and skills necessary to develop, translate, and apply methodological innovations to drive scientific discovery and inform effective, data-driven governance in the public and private sectors. A robust core curriculum will train students to design and implement effective data systems, architectures, and pipelines in both development and production environments. Students will learn to design and deploy methods of encoding, curating, analyzing, and communicating data and its multivariate characteristics for a variety of audiences and users.

Students will complete directed research in their area of interest and career aspiration. Research will engage students in independent conceptualization and research of original contributions to the field. Students will work under the supervision of a research advisor while conducting research.

Data mining in this context provides a formal basis for machine learning and knowledge discovery. This course investigates the construction of empirical models from data mining for systems with both discrete and continuous valued responses. It covers both estimation and classification, and explores both practical and theoretical aspects of data mining.</li></ul></div>
